Case
Case is useful considering that it provides information about a symbol
without being verbose or redundant. So choosing the right case for the right
symbol types is not mandatory but highly advised.

Case naming
snake case = "hello_world"
pascal case = "HelloWorld"
camel case = "helloWorld"
upper snake case = "HELLO_WORLD"


Symbols
variable : snake case
function : snake case
module : snake case
type : pascal case
compile-time symbol : upper case
macro : upper case
